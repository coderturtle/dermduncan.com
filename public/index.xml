      <description>This talk looked at Liberty Mutual’s transformation to Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and DevOps. For a large, heavily regulated industry, this task can not only be daunting, but viewed by many as impossible. Often, organizations try to reduce the friction through micro-fixes, but Eddie’s team asked how to change the culture to reduce the friction and concluded with the following final points:
 Don’t mandate DevOps. Give employees the chance to master their discipline with examples to set and follow.</description>

      <title>Forcing Visits to use SSL</title>

      <description>Intro Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether it&amp;rsquo;s a CakePHP app for a client, your own personal CMS, or any other web based application. If your passing around passwords or other sensitive info you should really implement SSL. SSL provides 2 main perks to your visitors.
 First it encrypts all communication that flies across the web. This prevents curious or devious billies from getting your secrets. Secondly it ensures to the user that your server is in fact who it claims, and not a nasty &amp;lsquo;man in the middle&amp;quot; attack.</description>

      <title>Gremlins</title>

      <guid>https://dermduncan.com/projects/creations/gremlins/</guid>
      <description>The original concept was based off my frenchie Swayze looking like a gremlin and kind of like the Netflix chaos monkeys, I was going to create a gremlin to do different tasks. At the moment it&amp;rsquo;s centered around my 3 main passions cooking, cloud and fitness. So for example, a cloud gremlin could create a static web site and would be pretty much a push button to create all the infrastructure and pipelines required.</description>
