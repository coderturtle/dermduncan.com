This talk looked at Liberty Mutual’s transformation to Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and DevOps. For a large, heavily regulated industry, this task can not only be daunting, but viewed by many as impossible. Often, organizations try to reduce the friction through micro-fixes, but Eddie’s team asked how to change the culture to reduce the friction and concluded with the following final points:

- Don’t mandate DevOps. Give employees the chance to master their discipline with examples to set and follow.
- Favor deep end-to-end accomplishments over broad but incremental steps forward. Focus on taking the right teams far before encouraging broad adoption.
- Centralize the platforms and tools that your teams shouldn’t be thinking about. Provide foundational services/commodities and let teams stay on purpose.
- Incorporate contributions from everyone; don’t stifle autonomy. Stay open to new ways of working.
- Challenge security policies, but respect intentions. Find new ways to enforce concerns without abandoning precaution.
