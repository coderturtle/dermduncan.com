The original concept was based off my frenchie Swayze looking like a gremlin and kind of like the Netflix chaos monkeys, I was going to create a gremlin to do different tasks. At the moment it's centered around my 3 main passions cooking, cloud and fitness. So for example, a cloud gremlin could create a static web site and would be pretty much a push button to create all the infrastructure and pipelines required.
